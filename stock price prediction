Key Analogies:
 * Macroeconomic Factor (Mf) <=> Geostrophic Wind (Vg): Both represent the dominant force driving the overall direction. In wind, it's the pressure gradient; in stocks, it's the macroeconomic conditions.
 * Stock Volatility (Vs) <=> Local Wind Effects (Vp): Both represent deviations and fluctuations caused by local factors. In wind, it's terrain and friction; in stocks, it's company-specific news or events.
 * Hurst Exponent <=> Atmospheric Stability:  The Hurst exponent provides insights into market regimes, similar to how atmospheric stability influences wind patterns.
 * Stock Price Prediction <=> Wind Direction Prediction:  Both involve combining the dominant force and local variations to predict the final outcome (direction of wind or movement of stock price).
This code incorporates the analogies with wind directly into the function docstrings, providing a clearer understanding of how the model relates to the original wind direction equation.
